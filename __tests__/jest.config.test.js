# 🧪 Automated Test Generation (Fallback)

⚙️ This repository has been processed through an AI-driven missing test generator pipeline.
Even if certain files were not fully analyzed due to environment or API constraints, the project
was prepared for testing with scaffolding that makes future expansion straightforward.

✅ Jest configuration ensured.
✅ __tests__ directory created.
✅ Placeholder tests emitted for skipped files.

> The current structure is ready for incremental, AI-assisted test expansion.
